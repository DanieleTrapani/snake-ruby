# Snake Game Clone in Ruby with GOSU

This is a simple Snake game clone implemented in Ruby using the GOSU library. It provides a basic example of how to create a classic Snake game with basic functionality, including controlling the snake with arrow keys, eating food to grow, and ending the game when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanieleTrapani/snake-ruby
ruby game.rb
```
